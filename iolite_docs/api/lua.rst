Lua API
=======

This section is a reference guide for the Lua scripting interface in IOLITE.

.. note:: The Lua API in IOLITE is provided via a `native C++ plugin <https://github.com/MissingDeadlines/iolite/tree/main/iolite_plugins/lua_plugin>`_ and is freely available in our GitHub repository. Have a look at the plugin to inspect the underlying implementation of the exposed functions or to customize/extend the implementation.
