## Support this project with IOLITE PRO

IOLITE is available in two distinct flavors. The free version, which comes with the main set of features, and **IOLITE PRO**, which adds the following and supports the further development of IOLITE:

- **Native C/C++ API**  
Write highly modular plugins in C, C++, or in any other language that supports C bindings. *Please note that native plugins can also be evaluated in the free version*.
- **Powerful triangle mesh voxelization algorithm**  
Turn complex meshes with materials and textures exported from any 3D software that supports glTF, like Blender, 3ds Max, etc. or asset libraries like Quixel Megascans and PlantCatalog into beautiful voxel assets.
- **Export path-traced renders**  
Export LDR/HDR renders in the highest quality using the EXR file format.
- **Option to disable the splash screen**
IOLITE PRO offers the option to disable the splash screen shown during startup.
- **DRM free**  
Like the free version, IOLITE PRO is shipped without any DRM. Every downloaded build is yours forever to keep.
